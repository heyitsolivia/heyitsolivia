                I make things for humans. I'm a senior designer who thinks and builds in systems, and leads teams in developing and applying thoughtful, inclusive approaches to difficult problems.

                </h1>    
                <p>
                    I‚Äôve been designing and building things for people over a decade now. I do my best work when I get to break down complex problems and apply thoughtful, inclusive approaches‚Äî working systematically and creating scalable solutions wherever possible, and always rooting every design decision in the needs of the user, first and foremost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I deliver complex products, defining their shape and breathing life into abstract visions, improving processes, practices and growing teams along the way. I‚Äôve taken lead roles across all steps of the product development cycle, working collaboratively and cross-functionally to plan and conduct user research, facilitate workshops to deeply understand business and stakeholder requirements, create user flows and visual designs, all the way through to building front-end design systems and refining interactions in code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I choose the right tool for the job and I build inclusively. I advocate for best practices around design systems, front-end performance, accessibility, and responsive development in order to deliver consistent experiences that are accessible to all people and performant across all platforms.
                
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some challenges I've enjoyed include leading and managing a distributed design team to develop a new eligibility application for <a className="link" href="https://www.navapbc.com/#healthcare-gov">HealthCare.gov</a> to replace legacy systems and provide over 7.5 million households with a streamlined, intuitive experience to get health coverage. I've also led a redesign and built from the ground up a data-rich interface for <a className="link" href="http://openstates.org">Open States</a>, an open-source product that allows the public to track bills, activity and other data aggregated from 50 state legislatures.

                <p>
                    Most recently, I've been spending my time as a product design consultant for two DC startups, helping to develop new products and build up design practices.

                <p>
                    I'd be super excited to work at an organization that shares and supports my values:
                </p>
                <ul>

                        <strong class="heading heading--small">People</strong>
                        <br/>
                        Your products or services create large-scale, positive impact for the people that use them or are affected by them.
                        Your team respects and empathizes with the people who use your services.
                        Your team members respect the people they work with, regardless of their role and title.
                        You have an HR team.

                        <br/>
                        You have diverse (non-men and non-white) folks in leadership roles.
                        Your hiring practices, work policies and team culture reflect your diverse and inclusive team.

                        Your culture and practices ensures that your team works sustainable hours, and they can work from home when they need to.
                        Your team members consistently work about 40 hours per week.

                        Your team works together to solve problems, share knowledge and collaborate with people across different roles like engineering, design, product, and support.
                        You offer professional development opportunities, and your team members have the space to continue growing no matter what stage of their career they‚Äôre in.
