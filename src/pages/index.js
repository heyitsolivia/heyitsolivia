        <p>👋🏻 Hey, it's Olivia.</p>
        <p>I make things for humans. I'm a senior designer who thinks and builds in systems, and leads teams in developing and applying thoughtful, inclusive approaches to difficult problems. I'm deeply passionate about designing technology and services that purposefully improves people's lives, especially in vulnerable or underserved communities.</p>
        <p>I work carefully and systematically, drawing from human-centered, research-based methodologies  to ask the right questions and champion the needs of the people we serve first and foremost, and to bring clarity and definition to large, complex problems.</p>
        <p>Challenges I've enjoyed working on include leading a design team to develop a new eligibility application for HealthCare.gov that replaces legacy systems, and provides more than 7.5 million households with a streamlined, intuitive experience to get health coverage with greater ease and peace of mind. I've also redesigned and built a data-rich interface from the ground up for Open States, an open-source product that allows the public to track what is happening in their state's capitol, creating consistency from the inconsistencies and differences across all 50 state legislatures, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.

        <p>In my free time, I like making things that bring people joy and delight. 🐶 </p>
        <p>In 2016 and 2018, I was named one of D.C.'s most Powerful Women Designers by DCFemTech. ⚡</p>
        <p>DC based, but NY born and raised.</p>
