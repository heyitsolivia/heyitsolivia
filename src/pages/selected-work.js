                <br/>
                I make things for humans. I'm a senior designer who thinks and builds in systems, and leads teams in developing and applying thoughtful, inclusive approaches to difficult problems. I'm deeply passionate about designing technology and services that purposefully improves people's lives, especially for vulnerable or underserved communities.
